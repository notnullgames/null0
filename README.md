This combines ideas from [pntr_app_starter](https://github.com/RobLoach/pntr_app_starter) with [wamr](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime) to make null0 game-engine (native runtime & libretro core.)

You can see a simple web-demo [here](https://notnullgames.github.io/null0) or [read the docs](https://notnullgames.vercel.app/null0).

```bash
# build native-host
npm run build:native

# build example carts
npm run build:carts

# run local watching web-server with webhost
npm start
```
